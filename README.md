#The frontend of the project is made using React.js with Redux for state management and Material-Ui framework. The todo app consists features like making
account for using the application. I use passport authencation system for authenticating the user. Before using the app you have to sign up with a 
username and password if you signup already you have to signin to use todo application. You can add whatever task you want to do with a option of category
also. Categorizing the task will help in giving priorty to the tasks. you can also update or modify the task if you want. check option is there to checked the
task and a delete option is also present to delete the task completely. The delete button willl delete the task from screen and database also. I use axios to
